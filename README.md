# Snowflake Cortex RAG Assistant Hands-On Lab 

## Prerequisites

### Snowflake Trial Account 
A Snowflake account with a user created with ACCOUNTADMIN permissions. This user will be used to get things setup in Snowflake.
We recommend completing this lab in a free 30-day trial account, since it will allow full account administration to configure integrations.

To sign up for a trial account:
1. Navigate to https://signup.snowflake.com/ in your browser
2. Select "Enterprise" as your Snowflake Edition
3. Select a cloud provider and region â€“ we have validated this lab on AWS cloud in the `US East (Northern Virginia)` region.

Once you've registered, you'll get an email that will bring you to Snowflake so that you can sign in. Make sure to Activate your account and pick a username and password that you will remember. This will be important for logging in later on.

### GitHub (optional)

If you'd like to commit changes to a fork of this repository, you will need a GitHub account.
If you don't already have a GitHub account you can create one for free.
Visit the Join GitHub page to get started.
It is strongly recommended to use your personal GitHub profile, as you will need permissions to enable actions at a later step.
